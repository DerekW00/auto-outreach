# AutoOutreach

AutoOutreach is an automated cold outreach tool designed to streamline LinkedIn connection sequences. It targets funded startups by identifying key decision-makers—such as Founders, CEOs, and Managers—and automates the creation of personalized connection notes and follow-up messages. This project is built for professionals who want to scale their networking efforts without sacrificing the personal touch.

## Why AutoOutreach?

It’s engineered to let you efficiently target the right prospects, craft tailored messages, and track your outreach performance—all in one platform.

## Features

- **Targeted Startup Identification:** Automatically discover recently funded startups.
- **Profile Extraction:** Scrape LinkedIn for decision-makers (Founders, CEOs, Managers, etc.).
- **Personalized Messaging:** Generate customizable connection requests and follow-up messages.
- **Workflow Automation:** Design and manage outreach sequences with ease.
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Monitor campaign performance to refine your strategy.
